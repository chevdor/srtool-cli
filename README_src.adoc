WARNING: This project is NOT the `srtool` docker image that is actually used to build Substrate Wasm Runtime. This utility requires docker to be installed and running and will invoke the `srtool` image to help you build a Substrate runtime.

This project is a cli interface to docker to simplify using the `srtool` docker image. With this executable, you no longer need
to set and maintain a long and complex alias, as currently described in the `srtool` documentation.

== Install

WARNING: If you previously defined `srtool` as an alias, you will first need to remove it first.

=== Clean up

If you used `srtool` in the past, you previously used an `srtool` alias. You can check with:

    type srtool

If you see some output mentioning "srtool is an alias for docker run...", you have an alias set and we need to remove it:

    unalias srtool

NOTE: This alias is likely set in your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`, make sure to remove this alias there as well.

=== Install

    cargo install --git https://github.com/chevdor/srtool-cli
