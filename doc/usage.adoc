srtool is cli allowing to control the srtool docker image

Usage: srtool [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  pull     Simply pull the srtool image and do not run anything else
  build    Start a new srtool container to build your runtime
  info     Provide information about the srtool container and your repo
  version  Show the versions of the srtool container. Use --version if you want the version of this executable
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -i, --image <IMAGE>
          Choose an alternative image. Beware to choose an image that is compatible with the original srtool image. Using a random image, you take the risk to NOT produce exactly the same deterministic result as srtool
          
          [default: docker.io/paritytech/srtool]

  -j, --json
          This option is DEPRECATED and has no effect

  -n, --no-cache
          Do not use the local cached tag value

  -e, --engine <ENGINE>
          By default, srtool-cli auto-detects whether you use Podman or Docker. You can force the engine if the detection does not meet your expectation. The default is auto and defaults to Podman.
          
          NOTE: Using Podman currently forces using --no-cache
          
          [env: ENGINE=docker]
          [default: auto]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
