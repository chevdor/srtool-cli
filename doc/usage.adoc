This utility helps starting a container from the srtool Docker image. It passes the right parameters
and environment variables to the container. Learn more about the srtool image here:
https://github.com/paritytech/srtool

USAGE:
    srtool [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help        Prints help information
    -j, --json        This option is DEPRECATED and has no effect
    -n, --no-cache    Do not use the local cached tag value
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i, --image <image>    Chose an alternative image. Beware to chose an image that is compatible
                           with the original srtool image. Using a random image, you take the risk
                           to NOT produce exactly the same deterministic result than srtool
                           [default: paritytech/srtool]
