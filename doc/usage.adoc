chevdor <chevdor@gmail.com>
This utility helps starting a container from the srtool Docker image. It passes the right parameters
and environment variables to the container. Learn more about the srtool image here:
https://github.com/paritytech/srtool

USAGE:
    srtool [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help        Prints help information
    -j, --json        This option is DEPRECATED and has no effect
    -n, --no-cache    Do not use the local cached tag value
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -i, --image <image>    Choose an alternative image. Beware to choose an image that is compatible
                           with the original srtool image. Using a random image, you take the risk
                           to NOT produce exactly the same deterministic result as srtool [default:
                           paritytech/srtool]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    build      Start a new srtool container to build your runtime
    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    info       Provide information about the srtool container and your repo
    pull       Simply pull the srtool image and do not run anything else
    version    Show the versions of the srtool container. Use --version if you want the version
               of this executable
