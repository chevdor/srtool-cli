Provide information about the srtool container and your repo

USAGE:
    srtool info [OPTIONS] --package <PACKAGE> [PATH]

ARGS:
    <PATH>    By default, srtool will work in the current folder. If your project is located in
              another location, you can pass it here [default: .]

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help                         Print help information
    -i, --image <IMAGE>                Choose an alternative image. Beware to choose an image that
                                       is compatible with the original srtool image. Using a random
                                       image, you take the risk to NOT produce exactly the same
                                       deterministic result as srtool [default: paritytech/srtool]
    -p, --package <PACKAGE>            Provide the runtime such as kusama-runtime, polkadot-runtime,
                                       etc... [env: PACKAGE=]
    -r, --runtime-dir <RUNTIME_DIR>    If your runtime is not in the standard location
                                       runtime/<chain_name> you can pass this args to help srtool
                                       find it [env: RUNTIME_DIR=]
    -V, --version                      Print version information
