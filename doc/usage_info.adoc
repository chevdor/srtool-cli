Provide information about the srtool container and your repo

Usage: srtool info [OPTIONS] --package <PACKAGE> [PATH]

Arguments:
  [PATH]
          By default, srtool will work in the current folder. If your project is located in another location, you can pass it here
          
          [default: .]

Options:
  -i, --image <IMAGE>
          Choose an alternative image. Beware to choose an image that is compatible with the original srtool image. Using a random image, you take the risk to NOT produce exactly the same deterministic result as srtool
          
          [default: docker.io/paritytech/srtool]

  -p, --package <PACKAGE>
          Provide the runtime such as kusama-runtime, polkadot-runtime, etc...
          
          [env: PACKAGE=]

  -r, --runtime-dir <RUNTIME_DIR>
          If your runtime is not in the standard location runtime/<chain_name> you can pass this args to help srtool find it
          
          [env: RUNTIME_DIR=]

  -e, --engine <ENGINE>
          By default, srtool-cli auto-detects whether you use Podman or Docker. You can force the engine if the detection does not meet your expectation. The default is auto and defaults to Podman.
          
          NOTE: Using Podman currently forces using --no-cache
          
          [default: auto]

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
