Start a new srtool container to build your runtime

Usage: srtool build [OPTIONS] --package <PACKAGE> [PATH]

Arguments:
  [PATH]
          By default, srtool will work in the current folder. If your project is located in another location, you can pass it here
          
          [default: .]

Options:
  -i, --image <IMAGE>
          Choose an alternative image. Beware to choose an image that is compatible with the original srtool image. Using a random image, you take the risk to NOT produce exactly the same deterministic result as srtool
          
          [default: docker.io/paritytech/srtool]

  -p, --package <PACKAGE>
          Provide the runtime such as kusama-runtime, polkadot-runtime, etc...
          
          [env: PACKAGE=]

  -j, --json
          Enable json output, same than the global --json option

  -a, --app
          Enable the "app" mode which is a mix of json output and outputting progress during the build. This flag is recommended for CI. the json output will be provided as a single line at the end in compact mode

  -e, --engine <ENGINE>
          By default, srtool-cli auto-detects whether you use Podman or Docker. You can force the engine if the detection does not meet your expectation. The default is auto and defaults to Podman.
          
          NOTE: Using Podman currently forces using --no-cache
          
          [env: ENGINE=docker]
          [default: auto]

  -r, --runtime-dir <RUNTIME_DIR>
          If your runtime is not in the standard location runtime/<chain_name> you can pass this args to help srtool find it
          
          [env: RUNTIME_DIR=]

      --build-opts <BUILD_OPTS>
          You may pass options to cargo directly here. WARNING, if you pass this value, the automatic build options for Kusama and Polkadot will not be passed and you need to take care of them manually. In general, you should never use this option unless you HAVE to
          
          [env: BUILD_OPTS=]

      --default-features <DEFAULT_FEATURES>
          Passing this is less involved than passing BUILD_OPTS. It allows changing the list of default features while keeping the automatic features detection. This value is useless if BUILD_OPTS is set
          
          [env: DEFAULT_FEATURES=]

      --profile <PROFILE>
          The default profile to build runtimes is always `release`. You may override the default with this flag
          
          [env: PROFILE=]
          [default: release]

      --no-cache
          Passing this flag allows completely disabling caching. As a result, no cargo-home will be mounted to the srtool image. There is no known issue with having the cache ON, this is why it is the default

      --root
          Run container image as root, this helps on Linux based systems

      --verbose
          Run the build script using the verbose option

      --no-wasm-std
          Passing this flag solves the issue when there are no standard library sources found in WASM runtime compilation

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
