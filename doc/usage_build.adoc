srtool-build 0.6.0
chevdor <chevdor@gmail.com>
Start a new srtool container to build your runtime

USAGE:
    srtool build [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --package <package> [path]

ARGS:
    <path>    By default, srtool will work in the current folder. If your project is located in
              another location, you can pass it here [default: .]

FLAGS:
    -a, --app        Enable the "app" mode which is a mix of json output and outputing progress
                     during the build. This flag is recommended for CI. the json output will be
                     provided as a single line at the end in compact mode
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -j, --json       Enable json output, same than the global --json option
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --build-opts <build-opts>
            You may pass options to cargo directly here. WARNING, if you pass this value, the
            automatic build options for Kusama and Polkadot will not be passed and you need to take
            care of them manually. In general, you should never use this option unless you HAVE to
            [env: BUILD_OPTS=]

        --default-features <default-features>
            Passing this is less involved than passing BUILD_OPTS. It allows changing the list of
            default features while keeping the automatic features detection. This value is useless
            if BUILD_OPTS is set [env: DEFAULT_FEATURES=]

    -p, --package <package>
            Provide the runtime such as kusama-runtime, polkadot-runtime, etc... [env: PACKAGE=]

        --profile <profile>
            The default profile to build runtimes is always `release`. You may override the default
            with this flag [env: PROFILE=] [default: release]

    -r, --runtime-dir <runtime-dir>
            If your runtime is not in the standard location runtime/<chain_name> you can pass this
            args to help srtool find it [env: RUNTIME_DIR=]
