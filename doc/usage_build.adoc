srtool-build 0.7.1
chevdor <chevdor@gmail.com>
Start a new srtool container to build your runtime

USAGE:
    srtool build [OPTIONS] --package <PACKAGE> [PATH]

ARGS:
    <PATH>    By default, srtool will work in the current folder. If your project is located in
              another location, you can pass it here [default: .]

OPTIONS:
    -a, --app
            Enable the "app" mode which is a mix of json output and outputting progress during the
            build. This flag is recommended for CI. the json output will be provided as a single
            line at the end in compact mode

        --build-opts <BUILD_OPTS>
            You may pass options to cargo directly here. WARNING, if you pass this value, the
            automatic build options for Kusama and Polkadot will not be passed and you need to take
            care of them manually. In general, you should never use this option unless you HAVE to
            [env: BUILD_OPTS=]

        --default-features <DEFAULT_FEATURES>
            Passing this is less involved than passing BUILD_OPTS. It allows changing the list of
            default features while keeping the automatic features detection. This value is useless
            if BUILD_OPTS is set [env: DEFAULT_FEATURES=]

    -h, --help
            Print help information

    -j, --json
            Enable json output, same than the global --json option

        --no-cache
            Passing this flag allows completely disabling caching. As a result, no cargo-home will
            be mounted to the srtool image. There is no known issue with having the cache ON, this
            is why it is the default

    -p, --package <PACKAGE>
            Provide the runtime such as kusama-runtime, polkadot-runtime, etc... [env: PACKAGE=]

        --profile <PROFILE>
            The default profile to build runtimes is always `release`. You may override the default
            with this flag [env: PROFILE=] [default: release]

    -r, --runtime-dir <RUNTIME_DIR>
            If your runtime is not in the standard location runtime/<chain_name> you can pass this
            args to help srtool find it [env: RUNTIME_DIR=]

    -V, --version
            Print version information
